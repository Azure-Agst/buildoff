# Chiles Build-Off Spigot Plugin

This is a plugin in open-source development, to help facilitate an upcoming event for the Chiles eSports club.

## Building

I use IntelliJ Idea for java, but your setup may vary. I'd recommend using the Spigot Tutorial [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-plugin-development/) to get set up!

## Contributing

Since the plugin is open source, we totally welcome contributions! We're not doing anything too fancy like forking, pushing a branch, etc etc. Just fork, contribute, and submit a PR. One of our devs will look at your work and give you feedback, then merge if it's good!
